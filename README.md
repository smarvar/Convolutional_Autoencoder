# Convolutional Autoencoder to reduce Noise in CT images of Breast Cancer

This repository contains a neural network based on a convolutional autoencoder that allows to eliminate noise in computed tomography images.

## Code

This script is designed to run in Google Colab and use the GPU to run it.
* File: Autoencoder_breast_2_0_.ipynb
* To load the set of CT images, the directory where they are located must be indicated in the ld.dataset function
* The load_dataset.py code allows you to generate the dataset with these images.

## Results

The results generated by the network show how it allows to eliminate Gaussian and Poisson noise in the test images. However, the network must be trained for a greater number of epochs, in order to improve the details and errors of the generated image. The limitation of this is in the execution time that Google Colab allows with the use of GPU, which is only a couple of hours. In the images folder, you can see some results
