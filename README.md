# Convolutional Autoencoder to reduce Noise in CT images of Breast Cancer

This repository contains a neural network based on a convolutional autoencoder that allows to eliminate noise in computed tomography images.

## Code

This script is designed to run in Google Colab and use the GPU to run it.
* File: Autoencoder_breast_2_0_.ipynb
* To load the set of CT images, the directory where they are located must be indicated in the ld.dataset function
* The load_dataset.py code allows you to generate the dataset with these images.
